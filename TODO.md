* Day 2: get rid of the functions, either moving them to a later point or
  removing completely. Start reading data right away, spend more time on
  reading data and cleaning it up.

* Day 2: add an overview of the different parentheses / brackets () [] {}
  ...
  add a slide on absolute vs relative directory paths

  spend more time on logical vectors, e.g. is.na()

  add selecting vectors / rows by logical vectors

* Day 3: introduce grep first, then gsub

 * limit the regular expressions to a minimum
 * make this part shorter

 * for the long / wide format: use the iris data set and show plots
   immediately

* Day 4 

 * start with graphics (iris data set?)

 * use only tidyverse for ordering and filtering? (filter & arrange)
