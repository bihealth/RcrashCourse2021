# Cleaning data
## A short note on organizing your data

 * If possible, use a specialized tool and not Excel (a database,
   specialized clinical data management system, REDCap etc.)

## And if you use Excel...

 If you use Excel, follow these rules:

   * Versionize your files
   * Check data for consistency (e.g. with R!)
   * Use preselected values 
   * Add a meta-data sheet describing the fields
   * do not color-code or format-code your information (e.g. denoting treatment in bold)
   * Add comments in separate fields
   * NEVER throw away or replace any identifiers, always keep the old identifiers
   * understand what you describe (patients? samples? assays?)
   * understand the difference between wide and long format

## And if you use Excel and don't follow these rules

  * brace yourself for bad times
  * get used to nasty remarks

## Cleaning data in the scope of data analysis

![](images/data-science.png){ width=600px }

## Substitutions (search & replace)

 * `gsub(string1, string2, text)` substitute all occurences of `string1` in
    by `string2` in `text`
 * `sub(...)` same, but only the first occurence

```{r}
## Clearly broken!
group <- c("Control", " control", "control ", "Control   ")
group <- gsub("Control", "control", group)
group <- gsub(" ", "", group)
```

Notes:

The above operations are so common that there are "shortcut" functions
defined in R:

```{r}
## get rid of the spaces
trimws(group)

## make everything lower case
tolower(group)

## make everything upper case
toupper(group)
```


## Regular expressions

Is there not a way to simplify things? 

```{r}
group <- c("Control", " control", "control ", "Control   ")

# one method
gsub(" ", "", group) # but what happens if the groups are "group 1", "group 2" etc?

# substitute at the end of the string
gsub(" $", "", group)

# at the beginning
gsub("^ ", "", group)

# any number of occurences
gsub(" *", "", group)
```

## Regular expression cont.

In regular expressions, some characters or strings have special meanings

 * Some mean what is supposed to be replaced (e.g. `.`, dot,
   means "any character")
 * Some mean how many times something gets matched; e.g. `*` means "any
   number of matches of the previous character, so `.*` means any character
   any number of times (like, everything)
 * Some characters at certain position may also have a special meaning
   (like `^` means "match the beginning of a string" and `$` at the end of
   a regular expression means "match at the end of a string").
 * A string like `[abc]` will match only a, b and c, but not d. You can use
   ranges, e.g. `[0-9]` or `[a-z]`

## Regular expression cont.

```{r}
foo <- c("a1_123", "a1_231", "a2_17", "B2_23", "c2_889")

# substitute digits only
gsub("[0-9]*", "", foo)

# substitute letters only
gsub("[a-z]*", "", foo)

# same, but case insensitive
gsub("[a-z]*", "", foo, ignore.case=TRUE)

# substitute everything after "_"
# dot means "any character"
gsub("_.*", "", foo)
```

## Regexps cont.

You can wrap gsub around another gsub

```{r}
vec <- c("mouse", " Mouse", "mus domesticus", "chicken", "Schicken", "Duck")
vec <- gsub("S*chicken", "Chicken", gsub("^m.*", "Mouse", gsub("^ *", "", vec)))

## same as

vec <- gsub("^ *", "", vec)
vec <- gsub("^m.*", "Mouse", vec)
vec <- gsub("S*chicken", "Chicken", vec)
```

## Exercise 3.1

Figure out how to use gsub to do the following tasks:

 * What matches all of the "ANKRD" genes in the following: `c("ANKRD22", "ank.rep.domain 12", "ifng-1", "ANKRD-33", "  ankrd23")`
 * Make the following uniform: `c("male", "Male ", "M", "F", "female", " Female")`
 * Using `gsub` and the `toupper` function, clean up the gene names such
   that they conform to the HGNC (all capital
   letters, no spaces, no dashes): `c("ankrd22", "ifng", "Nf-kb", " Cxcl 5", "CCL 6.", "ANK.r.d. 12")`
 * Read the data file `meta_data_botched.xlsx`. Spot and correct errors.

## Wide and Long format (demonstration)


## Wide and Long format

 Long advantages:

  * easier to filter, process, visualize, do statistics with
  * focused on measurement ("patient ID" or equivalent is a covariate, and so is measurement type)
 
 Wide advantages:

  * groups data by a covariate ("patient ID")
  * can be easier to manage (each column one measurement type)



## Converting from wide to long:

```{r}
wide <- read.table(header=TRUE, text='
 subject sex control cond1 cond2
       1   M     7.9  12.3  10.7
       2   F     6.3  10.6  11.1
       3   F     9.5  13.1  13.8
       4   M    11.5  13.4  12.9
')
pivot_longer(wide, cols=c("control", "cond1", "cond2"), 
  names_to="condition", values_to="measurement")
```



## Converting from long to wide

```{r}
long <- read.table(header=TRUE, text='
 subject  sampleID sex condition measurement
       1  ID000001 M   control         7.9
       1  ID000002 M     cond1        12.3
       1  ID000003 M     cond2        10.7
       2  ID000004 F   control         6.3
       2  ID000005 F     cond1        10.6
       2  ID000006 F     cond2        11.1
       3  ID000007 F   control         9.5
       3  ID000008 F     cond1        13.1
       3  ID000009 F     cond2        13.8
')
```

## Converting from long to wide

```{r}
## not what we wanted!!! Why?
pivot_wider(long, names_from="condition", values_from="measurement")

## Instead: 
pivot_wider(long, id_cols="subject", names_from="condition", values_from="measurement")
```

## Exercise 3.2

Convert the following files to long format:

 * `iris.csv`
 * `mtcars_wide.csv`
 * `labresults_wide.csv`
 * `cars.xlsx` (tricky!)


# Searching, sorting and selecting

## sort and order

`sort` directly sorts a vector:

```{r}
v <- sample(1:10)/10 # randomize numbers 1-10
sort(v)

## decreasing 
sort(v, decreasing=TRUE)

## same as
rev(sort(v))
```

However, `order` is more useful. It returns the *position*
of a value in a sorted vector.

```{r}
order(v)
order(v, decreasing=TRUE)
```

## sort and order cont.

`sort` and `order` can be applied to character vectors as well:

```{r}
l <- sample(letters, 10)
sort(l)
order(l, decreasing=TRUE)
```

Note that sorting values turned to a character vector will not give
expected results:

```{r}
v <- sample(1:200, 15)
sort(as.character(v))
```

## Sorting data frames

To sort a data frame according to one of its columns, we use `order` and
then select rows of a data frame based on that order. That is the "classic"
way of sorting.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(id=paste0("ID", 1:10), val=rnorm(10))
ord <- order(df$val)
df[ ord, ]
df[ order(df$val, decreasing=TRUE), ]
df[ order(abs(df$val), decreasing=TRUE), ]
```

For numeric values, instead of `decreasing=TRUE`, you can just order by
`-abs(df$val)`.

## Sorting data frames with tidyverse

Sorting with tidyverse is easier. 

```{r}
arrange(df, val)
arrange(df, -val)
arrange(df, -abs(val))
```

Note the lack of quotes around `val`! This is a feature in tidyverse which
has two effects:

 * it is easier to type (you save the typing of `df$`!
   imagine how much time you have now)
 * it is confusing for beginners ("why are there no quotes?", "when should
   I use quotes and when not?", "how does it know that it is `df$val` and
   not some other `val`?") 
 * makes programming confusing (what if
   "val" holds the *name* of the column that you would like to sort by? -
   use `.data[[val]]`; Or is some other vector by which you wish to sort?)


## Example

```{r, eval=TRUE}
## read the transcriptomic results data set
res <- read.csv("../Datasets/transcriptomics_results.csv")

## only interesting columns
res <- res[ , c(3, 5, 8:9) ]
colnames(res) <- c("Gene", "Description", "LFC", "p.value")
```


## Example cont.

We can use sort, factor and level to find out more about our data set:

```{r}
desc.sum <- summary(factor(res$Description))
head(sort(desc.sum, decreasing=TRUE))
```



## Example cont.

```{r}
## order by decreasing absolute logFC
ord <- order(abs(res$LFC), decreasing=TRUE)
res <- res[ord, ]
plot(res$LFC[1:250], type="b")

## then, order by p-value
ord <- order(res$p.value)
res <- res[ord, ]
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:250]), type="b")
plot(res$p.value[1:250], type="b", log="y")
```

## Plot with LOESS smoothing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lo <- loess.smooth(1:500, abs(res$LFC[1:500]))
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:500]), col="grey", type="b", bty="n",
  ylab="Log2 fold change")
lines(lo$x, lo$y)
```

## Plot with LOESS smoothing

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.width=7,fig.height=5}
## with echo=FALSE, this code does not show on presentation
## otherwise the figure does not fit!
ord <- order(abs(res$LFC), decreasing=TRUE)
res <- res[ord, ]
ord <- order(res$p.value)
res <- res[ord, ]

lo <- loess.smooth(1:500, abs(res$LFC[1:500]))
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:500]), col="grey", type="b", bty="n",
  ylab="Log2 fold change")
lines(lo$x, lo$y)

```

## Selecting / filtering of data frames

There are two ways, both simple. In both of them, you need to have a
logical vector that indicates which rows to keep and which to remove.

```{r eval=FALSE}
keep <- res$p.value < 0.05
res[ keep, ]

## or

filter(res, p.value < 0.05)
## note that we don't have to type "res$p.value", 
## see comment about tidyverse above
```

## Excercise 3.3

 * Load the example transcriptomic data (`transcriptomics_results.csv`)
 * Try sorting of the data frame; by gene name, by identifier, by log fold
   change, by absolute log fold change (you can use any method)
 * Create a data frame which contains only genes which have significant
   differences at p < 0.05 and abs(log2FC) > 1.5.
 * How many genes are significantly down-regulated?
 * Order the new data frame by Gene name (A-Z)

# Searching and subsetting

## Searching through data frames

With `%in%`, it is easy to select keywords matching a set.

```{r}
interferon <- c("TAP1","IFIH1","IRF7","PARP9","STAT1","PLSCR1",
                "IFITM1","HERC5","DDX60","USP18","RSAD2","IFIT1")
sel <- res$Gene %in% interferon
res[ sel, ] ## or: filter(res, Gene %in% interferon)
```

## `match()`

We can also use match, which for each element of one vector returns the
position of that element in the second vector:

```{r}
matches <- match(interferon, res$Gene)
res[matches, ]
```

Note however that `match()` looks for the *first* occurence of a match,
whereas `%in%` will return all matches.


## Searching for patterns

What if we don't know the exact name, or if we want to match a more general
pattern? 

For this, we can use `grepl()` (which returns a logical vector) or `grep()`
(which is the same as `which(grepl())`).


```{r}
int <- grep("Interferon", res$Description)
length(int) # no matches

int <- grep("Interferon", res$Description, ignore.case=TRUE)
head(int)
head(res[int, ])
```

## More regular expressions

```{r}
## search for GBP1, GBP2, GBP3, 
## but not GBP12 or pseudo-GBP1
sel <- grep("^GBP[123]$", res$Gene)
res[ sel, ]

## search for either cytokine or chemokine
sel <- grep("(cytokine|chemokine)", res$Description, ignore.case=TRUE)
length(sel)
head(res[ sel, ])
```

## More regular expressions (cont.)

We can use the parentheses for substitution as well. Please don't mind that
weird `\\1`, just learn it.

Remember – `.*` means any character (`.`) any number of times (`*`).
`[0-9]*` means any digit (`[0-9]`) any number of times (`*`).

```{r}
## say we only want the middle part
a <- c("ID-1-2020", "ID-3-2019", "ABC-4-2018")

## extract the middle part
gsub(".*-(.*)-.*", "\\1", a)
```

## Combining searches

We can use the logical operators (`&` and `|`) to combine searches. Thus,
we use `grepl()` rather than `grep()`.

```{r}
sel <- res$Gene %in% interferon
significant <- abs(res$LFC) > 1 & res$p.value < 0.05
sel <- sel & significant

res[sel, ] ## or: filter(res, sel)
```


## Excercise 3.4

 * Search for ribosomal genes. How many did you find?
 * Create a data frame which contains only genes that are not "Other" or
   "Unknown".
 * Find all significantly upregulated cytokines.
 * How many interleukine genes are significantly down-regulated?
