# Searching, sorting and selecting

## sort and order

`sort` directly sorts a vector:

```{r}
v <- sample(1:10)/10 # randomize numbers 1-10
sort(v)

## decreasing 
sort(v, decreasing=TRUE)

## same as
rev(sort(v))
```

However, `order` is more useful. It returns the *position*
of a value in a sorted vector.

```{r}
order(v)
order(v, decreasing=TRUE)
```

## sort and order cont.

`sort` and `order` can be applied to character vectors as well:

```{r}
l <- sample(letters, 10)
sort(l)
order(l, decreasing=TRUE)
```

Note that sorting values turned to a character vector will not give
expected results:

```{r}
v <- sample(1:200, 15)
sort(as.character(v))
```

## Sorting data frames

To sort a data frame according to one of its columns, we use `order` and
then select rows of a data frame based on that order. That is the "classic"
way of sorting.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(id=paste0("ID", 1:10), val=rnorm(10))
ord <- order(df$val)
df[ ord, ]
df[ order(df$val, decreasing=TRUE), ]
df[ order(abs(df$val), decreasing=TRUE), ]
```

For numeric values, instead of `decreasing=TRUE`, you can just order by
`-abs(df$val)`.

## Sorting data frames with tidyverse

Sorting with tidyverse is easier. 

```{r}
arrange(df, val)
arrange(df, -val)
arrange(df, -abs(val))
```

Note the lack of quotes around `val`! This is a feature in tidyverse which
has two effects:

 * it is easier to type (you save the typing of `df$`!
   imagine how much time you have now)
 * it is confusing for beginners ("why are there no quotes?", "when should
   I use quotes and when not?", "how does it know that it is `df$val` and
   not some other `val`?") 
 * makes programming confusing (what if
   "val" holds the *name* of the column that you would like to sort by? -
   use `.data[[val]]`; Or is some other vector by which you wish to sort?)


## Example

```{r, eval=TRUE}
## read the transcriptomic results data set
res <- read.csv("Datasets/transcriptomics_results.csv")

## only interesting columns
res <- res[ , c(3, 5, 8:9) ]
colnames(res) <- c("Gene", "Description", "LFC", "p.value")
```


## Example cont.

We can use sort, factor and level to find out more about our data set:

```{r}
desc.sum <- summary(factor(res$Description))
head(sort(desc.sum, decreasing=TRUE))
```



## Example cont.

```{r}
## order by decreasing absolute logFC
ord <- order(abs(res$LFC), decreasing=TRUE)
res <- res[ord, ]
plot(res$LFC[1:250], type="b")

## then, order by p-value
ord <- order(res$p.value)
res <- res[ord, ]
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:250]), type="b")
plot(res$p.value[1:250], type="b", log="y")
```

## Plot with LOESS smoothing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lo <- loess.smooth(1:500, abs(res$LFC[1:500]))
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:500]), col="grey", type="b", bty="n",
  ylab="Log2 fold change")
lines(lo$x, lo$y)
```

## Plot with LOESS smoothing

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.width=7,fig.height=5}
## with echo=FALSE, this code does not show on presentation
## otherwise the figure does not fit!
ord <- order(abs(res$LFC), decreasing=TRUE)
res <- res[ord, ]
ord <- order(res$p.value)
res <- res[ord, ]

lo <- loess.smooth(1:500, abs(res$LFC[1:500]))
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:500]), col="grey", type="b", bty="n",
  ylab="Log2 fold change")
lines(lo$x, lo$y)

```

## Selecting / filtering of data frames

There are two ways, both simple. In both of them, you need to have a
logical vector that indicates which rows to keep and which to remove.

```{r eval=FALSE}
keep <- res$p.value < 0.05
res[ keep, ]

## or

filter(res, p.value < 0.05)
## note that we don't have to type "res$p.value", 
## see comment about tidyverse above
```

## Excercise 3.3

 * Load the example transcriptomic data (`transcriptomics_results.csv`)
 * Try sorting of the data frame; by gene name, by identifier, by log fold
   change, by absolute log fold change (you can use any method)
 * Create a data frame which contains only genes which have significant
   differences at p < 0.05 and abs(log2FC) > 1.5.
 * How many genes are significantly down-regulated?
 * Order the new data frame by Gene name (A-Z)

# Searching and subsetting

## Searching through data frames

With `%in%`, it is easy to select keywords matching a set.

```{r}
interferon <- c("TAP1","IFIH1","IRF7","PARP9","STAT1","PLSCR1",
                "IFITM1","HERC5","DDX60","USP18","RSAD2","IFIT1")
sel <- res$Gene %in% interferon
res[ sel, ] ## or: filter(res, Gene %in% interferon)
```

## `match()`

We can also use match, which for each element of one vector returns the
position of that element in the second vector:

```{r}
matches <- match(interferon, res$Gene)
res[matches, ]
```

Note however that `match()` looks for the *first* occurence of a match,
whereas `%in%` will return all matches.


## Searching for patterns

What if we don't know the exact name, or if we want to match a more general
pattern? 

For this, we can use `grepl()` (which returns a logical vector) or `grep()`
(which is the same as `which(grepl())`).


```{r}
int <- grep("Interferon", res$Description)
length(int) # no matches

int <- grep("Interferon", res$Description, ignore.case=TRUE)
head(int)
head(res[int, ])
```

## More regular expressions

```{r}
## search for GBP1, GBP2, GBP3, 
## but not GBP12 or pseudo-GBP1
sel <- grep("^GBP[123]$", res$Gene)
res[ sel, ]

## search for either cytokine or chemokine
sel <- grep("(cytokine|chemokine)", res$Description, ignore.case=TRUE)
length(sel)
head(res[ sel, ])
```

## More regular expressions (cont.)

We can use the parentheses for substitution as well. Please don't mind that
weird `\\1`, just learn it.

Remember – `.*` means any character (`.`) any number of times (`*`).
`[0-9]*` means any digit (`[0-9]`) any number of times (`*`).

```{r}
## say we only want the middle part
a <- c("ID-1-2020", "ID-3-2019", "ABC-4-2018")

## extract the middle part
gsub(".*-(.*)-.*", "\\1", a)
```

## Combining searches

We can use the logical operators (`&` and `|`) to combine searches. Thus,
we use `grepl()` rather than `grep()`.

```{r}
sel <- res$Gene %in% interferon
significant <- abs(res$LFC) > 1 & res$p.value < 0.05
sel <- sel & significant

res[sel, ] ## or: filter(res, sel)
```


## Excercise 3.4

 * Search for ribosomal genes. How many did you find?
 * Create a data frame which contains only genes that are not "Other" or
   "Unknown".
 * Find all significantly upregulated cytokines.
 * How many interleukine genes are significantly down-regulated?

# Matching data sets

## Finding common IDs

We can use `intersect()` for that.

```{r}
set1 <- letters[1:5]
set2 <- letters[3:7]
intersect(set1, set2)
```


## Finding common IDs cont.


```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(ID=sample(letters, 15), value1=rnorm(15))
df2 <- data.frame(ID=sample(letters, 15), value2=rnorm(15))
common <- intersect(df1$ID, df2$ID)

df1[ match(common, df1$ID), ]
df2[ match(common, df2$ID), ]

cbind(df1[ match(common, df1$ID), ], df2[ match(common, df2$ID), ])
```

## Merging

A better, but more complex solution to merge two data frames is the
`merge()` function.

Some SQL terminology:

 * inner join: we are merging only common elements
 * outer join: we are making sure that elements from both sets are taken
   over
 * left outer join: same, but only for the first set
 * right outer join: same, but only for the second set


## Merging (cont.)

Usage of the `merge()` function:

```{r}
merge(df1, df2) # inner join by default
merge(df1, df2, all.x=TRUE) # left outer join
merge(df1, df2, all.y=TRUE) # right outer join
merge(df1, df2, all=TRUE) # outer join
```

Note: tidyverse contains functions `inner_join`, `outer_join` etc. which
look slightly more specific (but do the same).

## Merging (cont.)

The `by`, `by.x` and `by.y` parameters tell `merge` which columns contain
the identifiers by which to join. It is always safer to specify this
parameter!

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(ID=c("a", "a", "b", "c"), no=c(1, 2, 3, 4), 
  value=rnorm(4))
df2 <- data.frame(ID=c("a", "a", "b", "c"), no=c(1, 2, 3, 4), 
  value=rnorm(4))
merge(df1, df2)           ## not what we wanted
merge(df1, df2, by="ID")  ## not what we wanted
merge(df1, df2, by=c("ID", "no"))
```

## Merging (cont.)

A simpler (but requiring more steps) alternative would be to make a new
identifier:

```{r}
df1$ID2 <- paste(df1$ID, df1$no, sep=".")
df2$ID2 <- paste(df2$ID, df2$no, sep=".")
merge(df1, df2, by="ID2")
```

## Another example

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(subject.id=1:3, sex=c("M", "F", "F"), 
  age=c(28, 35, 29))
df2 <- data.frame(subject.id=rep(1:3, each=2), 
  timepoint=rep(1:2, 3), value=rnorm(6))
merge(df1, df2, by="subject.id")
```


## Excercise 4.1

The files `expression_data_vaccination_example.xlsx` and
`labresults_full.csv` contain data from the same study.

 1. read the first sheet from the XLSX file and the CSV file.
 3. Which columns ID the subjects? Are there any subjects in common? How do
    you match the subjects?
 5. We are interested only in the following information: Subject ID, ARM
    (group), Time point, sex, age, test name and the actual measurement.
    Are the measurements numeric? Remember, you can use expressions like `[ , c("ARM", "sex") ]` 
    to select the desired columns from a data set.
 4. Use the subjects to merge the two data frames however you see fit. Note
    that there are multiple time points per subject and multiple
    measurements per subject and time point.

# Creating the LABRES data set

## Labres data set

The following slides are for your reference only. You can trace how I
created the `labwide` data frame using meta-data from
`expression_data_vaccination_example.xlsx` and `labresults_full.csv` data
files. The created result can be found in the file
`labresults_wide_full.csv`.

The data set contains laboratory measurements for several parameters (such
as white blood cell count or C-reactive protein) for vaccinees vaccinated
with either Fluad (adjuvant-containing influenza vaccine), Agrippal (same,
but without adjuvant) or placebo, for several days before and after
vaccination.

## Reading and column selection

```{r,eval=TRUE}
targets <- read_excel("Datasets/expression_data_vaccination_example.xlsx", sheet = 1)
targets <- targets[ , c("USUBJID", "Timepoint", "ARM", "SEX", "AGE") ]
lab <- read.csv("Datasets/labresults_full.csv")
lab <- lab[ , 
  c("USUBJID", "LBTEST", "LBTESTCD", "LBORRES", "Timepoint") ]

## remove the "SCREEN" time point
lab <- lab[ lab$Timepoint != "SCREEN", ]

## not what we want!
merged <- merge(targets, lab, by="USUBJID")
table(merged$Timepoint.x, merged$Timepoint.y)
```

## Reading and column selection

We need to choose: do we want to keep all measurements and just fill out
meta-information from `targets`, or do we want only to keep the time points
present in the expression data set?

```{r,eval=TRUE}
## to keep all time points
targets2 <- targets[ , c("USUBJID", "ARM", "SEX", "AGE") ]

## remove duplicated lines
targets2 <- targets2[ !duplicated(targets2$USUBJID), ] 

## merge
merged_full <- merge(targets2, lab, by="USUBJID")

## this one drops all timepoints not present in "targets"
merged <- merge(targets, lab, by=c("USUBJID", "Timepoint"))
```

## Converting to wide format

```{r}
## this does not work as expected, because "LBTESTCD" 
## and "LBTEST" contain the same information – we cannot 
## store both in the column names

labwide <- pivot_wider(merged, names_from="LBTESTCD", values_from="LBORRES")
```

```{r eval=TRUE}
## this works
labwide <- pivot_wider(merged[ , colnames(merged) != "LBTEST"], names_from="LBTESTCD", values_from="LBORRES")
```

## Cleaning up

```{r,eval=TRUE}
sapply(labwide, class) # all measurements are character!
startpos <- which(colnames(labwide) == "ACA")
labwide2 <- data.frame(labwide[,1:(startpos-1)], data.matrix(labwide[,startpos:ncol(labwide)]))
which(is.na(labwide2), arr.ind=T)[,2]

## impute low measurements
labwide[,14] <- gsub("<", "", labwide[,14])
labwide[,16] <- gsub("<", "", labwide[,16])

## these column is all NA
labwide <- labwide[,-17]
labwide <- data.frame(labwide[,1:5], data.matrix(labwide[,6:35]))
```


# Simple statistics with R

## Descriptive statistics

`tapply(x, groups, func)` applies a function `func` to some data `x`
grouped by `groups`.

```{r}
labwide <- read_csv("Datasets/labresults_wide_full.csv")[, -1 ]
mean(labwide$NEUT)
sd(labwide$NEUT)

tapply(labwide$NEUT, labwide$ARM, mean)
tapply(labwide$NEUT, labwide$Timepoint, mean)
tapply(labwide$NEUT, 
  paste(labwide$ARM, labwide$Timepoint, sep="."), mean)
```

## Simple t.test

We define logical vectors to help us select the desired data.

```{r,eval=TRUE}
fluad    <- labwide$ARM == "FLUAD"
agrippal <- labwide$ARM == "AGRIPPAL"

d0 <- labwide$Timepoint == "D0"
d1 <- labwide$Timepoint == "D1"
```

## Simple t.test

Paired or not paired?

```{r,eval=TRUE}
tst <- "NEUT" # lymphocyte count
x <- as.data.frame(labwide)[,tst]
t.test(x[d0 & fluad], x[d1 & fluad])
t.test(x[d0 & fluad], x[d1 & fluad], paired=TRUE)
```

## Broom: cleaning up data

`tidy()` cleans up messy results of various standard statistical tests and
formats them into a nice, clean, TIDY data frame (or, rather, a tibble).

```{r,eval=TRUE,results="markdown"}
library(broom)
tidy(t.test(x[d0 & fluad], x[d1 & fluad], paired=TRUE))
```

## Caveat: paired data

We must make sure that all the data points are paired!

## Excercise 4.2

 * Run t-test for CRP (C-reactive protein), LYM (lymphocytes)
 * `wilcox.test()` is the U test / Mann Whitney test / Wilcoxon test. Try it. Are the p-values different?
 * use `tidy()` to clean up data
 * save the results for CRP and LYM in the data frames (with help of
   `tidy()`).
 * How can you combine two data frames (or tibbles, or matrices) row-wise?
   Look up the `rbind()` function. Create a single data frame with results
   for the CRP and LYM.
 * Adjust the p-values for multiple testing; create a q-value column using
   the function `p.adjust()`. What is the default method for correction for
   multiple testing?


## Simple basic plots (demonstration)

We have two main factors: ARM (the group) and Timepoint (before or 1 day
after vaccination). Therefore, we should plot accordingly.

```{r}
labwide$armcd <- gsub("(.).*", "\\1", labwide$ARM)
labwide$group <- paste(labwide$armcd, labwide$Timepoint, sep=".")

boxplot(NEUT ~ group, data=labwide)
```

## Simple basic plots (demonstration)

```{r,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
labwide$armcd <- gsub("(.).*", "\\1", labwide$ARM)
labwide$group <- paste(labwide$armcd, labwide$Timepoint, sep=".")

boxplot(NEUT ~ group, data=labwide)
```

## Simple basic plots (demonstration)

```{r,eval=TRUE}
library(beeswarm)
beeswarm(NEUT ~ group, data=labwide)
```

## Excercise 4.3

 * Create box plots for selected variables

## ggplot2 vs basic R plots


Basic R plots:

 * super simple for a beginner
 * messy if you try to make it nice
 * you can do anything
 * some tools only produce basic R
 * SUPER fast

ggplot2:

 * produces nice and complex graphics with less effort
 * requires a data frame
 * more uniform
 * very different syntax
 * some things really hard to achieve



## Plot for pairwise data

```{r,eval=TRUE,fig.width=10,fig.height=4.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(labwide, aes(x=Timepoint, y=NEUT, group=USUBJID, color=ARM)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

## Making it nicer

```{r,eval=TRUE,fig.width=10,fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(labwide, aes(x=Timepoint, y=NEUT, group=USUBJID)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(. ~ ARM)
```

## Making it nicer

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(labwide, aes(x=Timepoint, y=NEUT, group=USUBJID)) + 
  geom_line(color="grey") + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(. ~ ARM) +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("Neutrophiles") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Change in neutrophile count in different study arms")
```


## Making it nicer

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.width=10,fig.height=5}
ggplot(labwide, aes(x=Timepoint, y=NEUT, group=USUBJID)) + 
  geom_line(color="grey") + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(. ~ ARM) +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("Neutrophiles") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Change in neutrophile count in different study arms")
```
