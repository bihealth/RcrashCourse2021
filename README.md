# RcrashCourse2021

The CUBI R crash course

**Notes on lectures.** Lectures are always available as two files. The
Rmarkdown file (extension .Rmd) is the source file. It is easy to browse
and to understand, just click on it to view it.

HTML files (the ready presentations) are a bit more tricky. Github does not
allow viewing these files directly (I am working on a solution for that).
For now, right click on the "Download" and select "Save File As" ("Ziel
speichern unter"). Then click on the downloaded file.
