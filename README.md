# R crash course 11/2021

The CUBI R crash course

**Notes on lectures.** Lectures are always available as two files. The
Rmarkdown file (extension .Rmd) is the source file. It is easy to browse
and to understand, just click on it to view it. You can learn a bit of
Rmarkdown with that, and also you will see exactly how all the plots and R
output are generated.

HTML files (the ready presentations) are a bit more tricky. Github does not
allow viewing these files directly, if you click on them, you will see the
HTML source.

To view HTML files, use the following links:

## Lectures

 * [Lecture 1](https://bihealth.github.io/RcrashCourse2021/Lectures/lecture_01.html) 
 * [Lecture 2](https://bihealth.github.io/RcrashCourse2021/Lectures/lecture_02.html) 

**Scripts from the Course.** The scripts with analysis for each day are provided in the folder Scripts/ . They contain commands discussed during the lectures and example solutions for the exercises.
