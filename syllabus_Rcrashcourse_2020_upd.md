# Date and location

March 1st - March 5th, 2020, 13:30 – 18:00, online. Please plan additional
time for homeworks.

# Course aim

The best way to learn a programming language is to use it everyday to solve
real tasks and problems. However, how can you do that if you have never
programmed before?

The course will give you a practical introduction to using R. Focusing on
real world problems and solutions rather than theory, it aims to give you a
launch pad to start using R in your everyday work for basic tasks such as
data import and export, writing reports, plotting and some rudimentary
statistics, and also as an entry point to advance in learning R.

# Course overview

The course is aimed to give you a solid basis for using R in your everyday
scientific endavours even if you have no previous knowledge of R or any
other programming language.

After completing the course, you will be able to: 
 
 * exchange data between R and spreadsheet programs such as Excel
 * manipulate and display the data
 * generate various types of plots 
 * run simple statistical analysis (t test, non-parametric tests, basic ANOVA,
   basic linear regression)
 * create reports from your analysis in a number of formats

Most importantly, you will learn from day 1 what the advantages of using a
programming language for your data analysis are as well as where the
pitfalls and potential problems lie.

We will introduce subjects rapidly and in a simple manner without going
into much depth, and then return to selected topics many times, always
broadening the knowledge on the subject. At all stages, you will have
enough time to ask questions, try out various things and discuss your
options.


# Lesson plan

 1. Launching into R: working with rstudio, moving around, opening a file,
    very basic programming basics: variables, functions
 2. Matrices and data frames: the data types that make R powerful; more on
    reading and writing files; wide and long format
 3. Working with real data: cleaning up data; merging; factors; regular
    expressions primer
 4. Basic statistical calculations; simple plots
 5. The power of R: demonstrations, forages in ggplot and tidyverse,
    complex plots and statistical analyses



# Course prerequisites

No knowledge of R or programming is necessary. However, you need
a laptop with an installation of rstudio, an easy to use Open Source
interface for R available for free from
[http://rstudio.com](http://rstudio.com).

You are encouraged to work with your own data sets, preferably as CSV or Excel
files.
